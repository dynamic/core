# Social Sharing
Add social sharing links and buttons without the bloat.

The widgets provided by Twitter, Facebook, and other services require numerous HTTP requests and can really hurt the performance of your sites and apps. These simple CSS and HTML snippets make it easy for you to go social - without hurting site performance.
